# NBAbot

Anyone that knows me knows I love to play and watch basketball.

I was on a couple basketabll servers on discord and i noticed that there wasn't a player of the week command on any of the bots. <br/>
So I made NBAbot - discord bot that provides unique player of the week information by scraping and parsing through realgm.com with Beautiful Soup. <br/> 
I noticed a pattern in the urls based on the player names on basketball-reference.com so I restructured scraped data to get corresponding player image
(I may make a player image api since I was not able to find one while making this). <br/>
The bot creates and sends discord embeds to a channel using Discord.py and OOP.
